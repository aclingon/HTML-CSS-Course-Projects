<p> Here is a quote from Dostoyevsky about animals:</p>

<blockquote cite="https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/tag/animals">
People speak sometimes about the bestial cruelty of man but that is terribly unjust and offensive to beasts, no animal could ever be so cruel as man, so artfully, so artistically cruel.
</blockquote>
